Learning Data Exploration and implementing through a project 

A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input.

This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings

During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys. 

In this project of recommendation system in R, we will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system
